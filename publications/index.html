Brain motion was primarily rostrally and laterally directed, and was tightly correlated with locomotion, but not with respiration or the cardiac cycle. Electromyography recordings in abdominal muscles and microCT reconstructions of the trunk and spinal vasculature showed that brain motion was driven by abdominal muscle contractions that activate a hydraulic-like vascular connection between the nervous system and the abdominal cavity. Externally-applied abdominal pressure generated brain motion similar to those seen during abdominal muscle contractions. Simulations showed that brain motion drives substantial volumes of interstitial fluid through and out of the brain (at volumetric rates several times higher than production) into the subarachnoid space, in the opposite direction of fluid flow seen during sleep. The brain is hydraulically linked to the abdominal compartment, and fluid flow in the brain is coupled to body movements, providing a mechanism by which the mechanics of the viscera directly impact brain health.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">BioRxiv</abbr></div> <div id="RN19687" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Type-I nNOS neurons orchestrate cortical neural activity and vasomotion</div> <div class="author">Turner, K.

We sought to uncover the role of a sparse but unusual population of genetically-distinct interneurons known as type-I nNOS neurons, using a novel pharmacological strategic to unilaterally ablate these neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. Region-specific ablation produced changes in both neural activity and vascular dynamics, decreased power in the delta-band of the local field potential, reduced sustained vascular responses to prolonged sensory stimulation, and abolished the post-stimulus undershoot in cerebral blood volume. Coherence between the left and right somatosensory cortex gamma-band power envelope and blood volume at ultra-low frequencies was decreased, suggesting type-1 nNOS neurons integrate long-range coordination of brain signals. Lastly, we observed decreases in the amplitude of resting-state blood volume oscillations and decreased vasomotion following the ablation of type-I nNOS neurons. This demonstrates that a small population of nNOS-positive neurons are indispensable for regulating both neural and vascular dynamics in the whole brain and implicates disruption of these neurons in diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to sleep disturbances.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Nat Commun</abbr></div> <div id="RN19649" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Aging drives cerebrovascular network remodeling and functional changes in the mouse brain</div> <div class="author">Bennett, H.

Whole-brain vascular tracing shows an overall  10% decrease in vascular length and branching density with  7% increase in vascular radii in aged brains. Light sheet imaging with 3D immunolabeling reveals increased arteriole tortuosity of aged brains. Notably, vasculature and pericyte densities show selective and significant reductions in the deep cortical layers, hippocampal network, and basal forebrain areas. We find increased blood extravasation, implying compromised blood-brain barrier function in aged brains. Moreover, in vivo imaging in awake mice demonstrates reduced baseline and on-demand blood oxygenation despite relatively intact neurovascular coupling.

However, whether neurovascular coupling is the same in neonatal animals as adults is controversial, as both canonical and inverted responses have been observed. We investigated the nature of neurovascular coupling in unanesthetized neonatal mice using optical imaging, electrophysiology, and BOLD fMRI. We find in neonatal (postnatal day 15, P15) mice, sensory stimulation induces a small increase in blood volume/BOLD signal, often followed by a large decrease in blood volume. An examination of arousal state of the mice revealed that neonatal mice were asleep a substantial fraction of the time, and that stimulation caused the animal to awaken. As cortical blood volume is much higher during REM and NREM sleep than the awake state, awakening occludes any sensory-evoked neurovascular coupling. When neonatal mice are stimulated during an awake period, they showed relatively normal (but slowed) neurovascular coupling, showing that that the typically observed constriction is due to arousal state changes. These result show that sleep-related vascular changes dominate over any sensory-evoked changes, and hemodynamic measures need to be considered in the context of arousal state changes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">EJP</abbr></div> <div id="zhang2022ejp" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Could respiration-driven blood oxygen changes modulate neural activity?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, Haselden, W.

Oxygen levels can be dynamically increased by increases in respiration rate that are tied to the arousal state of the brain and cognition, and not necessarily linked to exertion by the body. Why these changes in respiration occur when oxygen is already adequate has been a long-standing puzzle. In humans, performance on cognitive tasks can be affected by very high or very low oxygen levels, but whether the physiological changes in blood oxygenation produced by respiration have an appreciable effect is an open question. Oxygen has direct effects on potassium channels, increases the degradation rate of nitric oxide, and is rate limiting for the synthesis of some neuromodulators. We discuss whether oxygenation changes due to respiration contribute to neural dynamics associated with attention and arousal.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">CellRep</abbr></div> <div id="RN16421" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quantitative relationship between cerebrovascular network and neuronal cell types in mice</div> <div class="author">Wu, Y.T., Bennett, H.

However, ubiquitous facial and body motions (fidgeting) are prime drivers of spontaneous fluctuations in neural and hemodynamic signals. During periods without movement, animals can rapidly transition into sleep, and the hemodynamic signals tied to arousal state changes can be several times larger than sensory-evoked responses. Given the outsized influence of facial and body motions and arousal signals in neural and hemodynamic signals, it is imperative to detect and monitor these events in experiments with un-anesthetized animals. Aim: To cover the importance of monitoring behavioral state in imaging experiments using un-anesthetized rodents, and describe how to incorporate detailed behavioral and physiological measurements in imaging experiments.Approach: We review the effects of movements and sleep-related signals (heart rate, respiration rate, electromyography, intracranial pressure, whisking, and other body movements) on brain hemodynamics and electrophysiological signals, with a focus on head-fixed experimental setup. We summarize the measurement methods currently used in animal models for detection of those behaviors and arousal changes. We then provide a guide on how to incorporate this measurements with functional brain imaging and electrophysiology measurements. Results: We provide a how-to guide on monitoring and interpreting a variety of physiological signals and their applications to NVC experiments in awake behaving mice. Conclusion: This guide facilitates the application of neuroimaging in awake animal models and provides neuroscientists with a standard approach for monitoring behavior and other associated physiological parameters in head-fixed animals.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PLoS Bio</abbr></div> <div id="RN12542" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Origins of 1/f-like tissue oxygenation fluctuations in the murine cortex</div> <div class="author">Zhang, Q.#, , Gheres, K.

Though these oscillations have been interpreted as being driven by neural activity, the origin of these 1/f-like oscillations is not well understood. Here, to gain insight of the origin of the 1/f-like oxygen fluctuations, we investigated the dynamics of tissue oxygenation and neural activity in awake behaving mice. We found that oxygen signal recorded from the cortex of mice had 1/f-like spectra. However, band-limited power in the local field potential did not show corresponding 1/f-like fluctuations. When local neural activity was suppressed, the 1/f-like fluctuations in oxygen concentration persisted. Two-photon measurements of erythrocyte spacing fluctuations and mathematical modeling show that stochastic fluctuations in erythrocyte flow could underlie 1/f-like dynamics in oxygenation. These results suggest that the discrete nature of erythrocytes and their irregular flow, rather than fluctuations in neural activity, could drive 1/f-like fluctuations in tissue oxygenation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Nat Commun</abbr></div> <div id="RN8382" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cerebral oxygenation during locomotion is modulated by respiration</div> <div class="author"> <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, Roche, M., Gheres, K.

We measured oxygen levels in the cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during locomotion using polarography, spectroscopy, and two-photon phosphorescence lifetime measurements of oxygen sensors. We find that locomotion significantly and globally increases cerebral oxygenation, specifically in areas involved in locomotion, as well as in the frontal cortex and the olfactory bulb. The oxygenation increase persists when neural activity and functional hyperemia are blocked, occurred both in the tissue and in arteries feeding the brain, and is tightly correlated with respiration rate and the phase of respiration cycle. Thus, breathing rate is a key modulator of cerebral oxygenation and should be monitored during hemodynamic imaging, such as in BOLD fMRI.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">eLife</abbr></div> <div id="RN8173" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Anatomical basis and physiological role of cerebrospinal fluid transport through the murine cribriform plate</div> <div class="author">Norwood, J.

Here, we characterized the anatomy and physiological function of the CSF outflow pathway along the olfactory sensory nerves through the cribriform plate, and into the nasal epithelia. Chemical ablation of olfactory sensory nerves greatly reduced outflow of CSF through the cribriform plate. The reduction in CSF outflow did not cause an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), consistent with an alteration in the pattern of CSF drainage or production.

These movements are accompanied by changes in neural activity in sensory and motor regions of the brain. The frequency of these motions varies in time, is affected by sensory stimuli, arousal levels, and pathology. These fidgeting behaviors can be entrained by sensory stimuli. Fidgeting behaviors will cause distributed, bilateral functional activation in the 0.01 to 0.1 Hz frequency range that will show up in functional magnetic resonance imaging and wide-field calcium neuroimaging studies, and will contribute to the observed functional connectivity among brain regions. However, despite the large potential of these behaviors to drive brain-wide activity, these fidget-like behaviors are rarely monitored. We argue that studies of spontaneous and evoked brain dynamics in awake animals and humans should closely monitor these fidgeting behaviors. Differences in these fidgeting behaviors due to arousal or pathology will "contaminate" ongoing neural activity, and lead to apparent differences in functional connectivity. Monitoring and accounting for the brain-wide activations by these behaviors is essential during experiments to differentiate fidget-driven activity from internally driven neural dynamics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Nat Neurosci</abbr></div> <div id="RN5660" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Weak correlations between hemodynamic signals and ongoing neural activity during the resting state</div> <div class="author">Winder, A.

We tested this coupling by simultaneously measuring neural activity and changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the somatosensory cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during periods of true rest and during whisker stimulation and volitional whisking. We found that neurovascular coupling was similar across states and that large, spontaneous CBV changes in the absence of sensory input were driven by volitional whisker and body movements. Hemodynamic signals during periods of rest were weakly correlated with neural activity. Spontaneous fluctuations in CBV and vessel diameter persisted when local neural spiking and glutamatergic input were blocked, as well as during blockade of noradrenergic receptors, suggesting a non-neuronal origin for spontaneous CBV fluctuations. Spontaneous hemodynamic signals reflect a combination of behavior, local neural activity, and putatively non-neural processes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Neuroimage</abbr></div> <div id="RN2027" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Time to wake up: Studying neurovascular coupling and brain-wide circuit function in the un-anesthetized animal</div> <div class="author">Gao, Y.

An accurate interpretation of the hemodynamic changes that underlie fMRI signals depends on the understanding of the quantitative relationship between changes in neural activity and changes in cerebral blood flow, oxygenation and volume. While there has been extensive study of neurovascular coupling in anesthetized animal models, anesthesia causes large disruptions of brain metabolism, neural responsiveness and cardiovascular function. Here, we review work showing that neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal are profoundly different from those in the anesthetized state. We argue that the time is right to study neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal to bridge the physiological mechanisms that underlie animal and human neuroimaging signals, and to interpret them in light of underlying neural mechanisms. Lastly, we discuss recent experimental innovations that have enabled the study of neurovascular coupling and brain-wide circuit function in un-anesthetized and behaving animal models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">AMHP</abbr></div> <div id="RN2273" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Autonomic Cardiovascular Responses to Orthostatic Stress After a Short Artificial Gravity Exposure</div> <div class="author"> <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, Evans, J.

Effects of a single AG exposure are currently unknown. METHODS: We tested cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress in 16 hypovolemic subjects (9 men and 7 women), once following a single, short ( approximately 90 min) bout of AG and once following a similar period of head-down bed rest (HDBR). Hypovolemia was produced by intravenous furosemide infusion (20 mg) and orthostatic stress was produced by combined 70 degrees head-up tilt (HUT) and progressively increasing lower body negative pressure until symptoms of presyncope developed. To assess reflex-induced changes in cardiovascular regulation, heart rate and blood pressure variability were analyzed by spectral analysis and baroreflex activity was evaluated by transfer function analysis. RESULTS: Compared to HDBR, a short AG exposure increased men’s low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) power of systolic blood pressure (SBPLF), but did not change women’s SBPLF responses to orthostatic stress. In response to 70 degrees HUT, compared to supine, low frequency phase delay (PhaseLF) between systolic blood pressure and RR intervals increased by approximately 20% following HDBR, but did not change following AG, reflecting improved baroreflex activity at a milder level of orthostatic stress after AG. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a short bout of AG increased both sympathetic and baroreflex responsiveness to orthostatic stress in hypovolemia-induced, cardiovascular-deconditioned men and women, which may contribute to the AG-induced improvement of OTL shown in our previous reports.Zhang Q, Evans JM, Stenger MB, Moore FB, Knapp CF.

Upon standing, the change in vascular resistance is positively related to size.The height/weight relationships of cardiac output and vascular resistance to body size are responsible for blood pressure relationships to body size.These basic components of blood pressure could help distinguish normal from abnormal blood pressures in young adults by providing a more effective scaling mechanism. Introduction: Effects of body size on inter-subject blood pressure (BP) variability are not well established in adults. We hypothesized that relationships linking stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) with body size would account for a significant fraction of inter-subject BP variability. Methods: Thirty-four young, healthy adults (19 men, 15 women) participated in 38 stand tests during which brachial artery BP, heart rate, SV, CO, TPR, and indexes of body size were measured/calculated. Results: Steady state diastolic arterial BP was not significantly correlated with any index of body size when subjects were supine. However, upon standing, the more the subject weighed, or the taller s/he was, the greater the increase in diastolic pressure. Systolic pressure strongly correlated with body weight and height both supine and standing. Diastolic and systolic BP were more strongly related to height, weight and body surface area than to body mass index. When supine: lack of correlation between diastolic pressure and body size, resulted from the combination of positive SV correlation and negative TPR correlation with body size. The positive systolic pressure vs. body size relationship resulted from a positive SV vs. height relationship. In response to standing: the positive diastolic blood pressure vs. body size relationship resulted from the standing-induced, positive increase in TPR vs. body size relationship. The relationships between body weight or height with SV and TPR contribute new insight into mechanisms of BP regulation that may aid in the prediction of health in young adults by providing a more effective way to scale BP with body size.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">EJAP</abbr></div> <div id="RN704" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory phase synchronization in normovolemic and hypovolemic humans</div> <div class="author"> <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, Patwardhan, A.

Four men and six women were tested during graded head-up tilt (HUT) in both euhydration and dehydration (DEH) conditions. Continuous R-R intervals (RRI), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiration were investigated in low (LF 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF 0.15-0.4 Hz) frequency ranges using a phase synchronization index (lambda) ranging from 0 (complete lack of interaction) to 1 (perfect interaction) and a directionality index (d), where a positive value of d reflects oscillator 1 driving oscillator 2, and a negative value reflects the opposite driving direction. Surrogate data analysis was used to exclude relationships that occurred by chance. In the LF range, respiration was not synchronized with RRI or SBP, whereas RRI and SBP were phase synchronized. In the HF range, phases among all variables were synchronized. DEH reduced lambda among all variables in the HF and did not affect lambda between RRI and SBP in the LF region. DEH reduced d between RRI and SBP in the LF and did not affect d among all variables in the HF region. Increasing lambda and decreasing d between SBP and RRI were observed in the LF range during HUT. Decreasing lambda between SBP and RRI, respiration and RRI, and decreasing d between respiration and SBP were observed in the HF range during HUT.

Therefore, one important goal of spaceflight-related research is the development of countermeasures to prevent post flight OI. Given the rarity and expense of spaceflight, countermeasure development requires ground-based simulations of partial gravity to induce appropriate orthostatic effects on the human body, and to test the efficacy of potential countermeasures. To test the efficacy of upright lower body positive pressure (LBPP) as a model for simulating cardiovascular responses to lunar and Martian gravities on Earth, cardiovascular responses to upright LBPP were compared with those of head-up tilt (HUT), a well-accepted simulation of partial gravity, in both ambulatory and cardiovascularly deconditioned subjects. Results indicate that upright LBPP and HUT induced similar changes in cardiovascular regulation, supporting the use of upright LBPP as a potential model for simulating cardiovascular responses to standing and moving in lunar and Martian gravities. To test the efficacy of a short exposure to artificial gravity (AG) as a countermeasure to spaceflight-induced OI, orthostatic tolerance limits (OTL) and cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress were tested in cardiovascularly deconditioned subjects, using combined 70º head-up tilt and progressively increased lower body negative pressure, once following 90 minutes AG exposure and once following 90 minutes of -6º head-down bed rest (HDBR). Results indicate that a short AG exposure increased OTL of cardiovascularly deconditioned subjects, with increased baroreflex and sympathetic responsiveness, compared to those measured after HDBR exposure. To gain more insight into mechanisms of causal connectivity in cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory oscillations during orthostatic challenge in both ambulatory and cardiovascularly deconditioned subjects, couplings among R-R intervals (RRI), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory oscillations in response to graded HUT and dehydration were studied using a phase synchronization approach. Results indicate that increasing orthostatic stress disassociated interactions among RRI, SBP and respiration, and that dehydration exacerbated the disconnection. The loss of causality from SBP to RRI following dehydration suggests that dehydration also reduced involvement of baroreflex regulation, which may contribute to the increased occurrence of OI.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">EJAP</abbr></div> <div id="RN703" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Hypovolemic men and women regulate blood pressure differently following exposure to artificial gravity</div> <div class="author">Evans, J.

In seeking a countermeasure to space flight-induced orthostatic intolerance, we previously determined that exposure to artificial gravity (AG) training in a centrifuge improved orthostatic tolerance of ambulatory subjects. This protocol was more effective in men than women and more effective when subjects exercised. METHODS: We now determine the orthostatic tolerance limit (OTL) of cardiovascularly deconditioned (furosemide) men and women on one day following 90 min of AG compared to a control day (90 min of head-down bed rest, HDBR). RESULTS: There were three major findings: a short bout of artificial gravity improved orthostatic tolerance of hypovolemic men (30 %) and women (22 %). Men and women demonstrated different mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation on AG and HDBR days; women maintained systolic blood pressure the same after HDBR and AG exposure while men’s systolic pressure dropped (11 +/- 2.9 mmHg) after AG. Third, as presyncopal symptoms developed, men’s and women’s cardiac output and stroke volume dropped to the same level on both days, even though the OTL test lasted significantly longer on the AG day, indicating cardiac filling as a likely variable to trigger presyncope. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Even with gender differences, AG should be considered as a space flight countermeasure to be applied to astronauts before reentry into gravity, (2) men and women regulate blood pressure during an orthostatic stress differently following exposure to artificial gravity and (3) the trigger for presyncope may be cardiac filling.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">EJAP</abbr></div> <div id="RN705" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Acute cardiovascular autonomic responses to inhaled particulates</div> <div class="author">Evans, J.

In particular, heart rate variability responses to high levels of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), similar to responses observed during direct smoking, have been reported. We sought to determine whether such responses could be observed at lower particulate concentrations. METHODS: We monitored cardiovascular responses of non-smoking 21 women and 19 men to work-place-relevant levels of: ETS, cooking oil fumes (Coil), wood smoke (WS), and water vapor as sham control. Responses, tested on three consecutive days (random order of aerosol presentation), were averaged for each subject. RESULTS: Low frequency spectral powers of heart rate and blood pressure rose during recovery from exposure to particulate, but not to sham exposures. At breathing frequencies, spectral power of men’s systolic pressure doubled, and baroreflex effectiveness increased, following ETS exposure. An index of sympathetic control of heart rate was more pronounced in men than women, in response to ETS and Coil, compared to WS and sham. CONCLUSIONS: When measured under controlled conditions, autonomic activities in non-smoking men and women exposed to low level, short term, particulate concentrations were similar to those observed during longer term, higher level exposures to ETS and to direct smoking. These increased indexes of sympathetic control of heart rate and peripheral vasomotion followed introduction of particulates by about 15 min. Finally, coupling of heart rate and systolic pressure indicated an increase in baroreflex activity in the response to breathing ETS that was less effective in men than women.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ASEM</abbr></div> <div id="RN706" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Simulations of gravitational stress on normovolemic and hypovolemic men and women</div> <div class="author"> <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, Knapp, C.

To determine whether upright lower body positive pressure (LBPP) provides a suitable space mission simulation, we investigated the cardiovascular responses of normovolemic and hypovolemic men and women to supine and orthostatic stress induced by head-up tilt (HUT) and upright LBPP, representing standing in lunar, Martian, and Earth gravities. METHODS: Six men and six women were tested in normovolemic and hypovolemic (furosemide, intravenous, 0.5 mg x kg(-1)) conditions. Continuous electrocardiogram, blood pressure, segmental bioimpedance, and stroke volume (echocardiography) were recorded supine and at lunar, Martian, and Earth gravities (10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 80 degrees HUT vs. 20%, 40%, and 100% bodyweight upright LBPP), respectively. Cardiovascular responses were assessed from mean values, spectral powers, and spontaneous baroreflex parameters. RESULTS: Hypovolemia reduced plasma volume by approximately 10% and stroke volume by approximately 25% at supine, and increasing orthostatic stress resulted in further reductions. Upright LBPP induced more plasma volume losses at simulated lunar and Martian gravities compared with HUT, while both techniques induced comparable central hypovolemia at each stress. Cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress were comparable between HUT and upright LBPP in both normovolemic and hypovolemic conditions; however, hypovolemic blood pressure was greater during standing at 100% bodyweight compared to 80 degree HUT due to a greater increase of total peripheral resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The comparable cardiovascular response to HUT and upright LBPP support the use of upright LBPP as a potential model to simulate activity in lunar and Martian gravities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2011</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Li2011JSDU" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The effect of resampling on spectral analysis of pulse interval series</div> <div class="author">Li, L., Yang, J., Liu, C., Liu, C.,  <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, and Li, K. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Shandong University (Engineering &amp; Science)</em> 2011 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/li-2011-jsdu.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The effect of re-sampling on spectral analysis of pulse interval series was systematically analyzed.The method of the mean pulse rate as the re-sampling rate was proposed,which could provide theoretical support for pulse rate variability.Four methods,the nearest neighbor interpolation,piecewise linear interpolation,piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation and cubic spline interpolation,were applied to re-sample the simulated pulse interval series.The Welch periodogram and the Auto-regressive model were used for spectral analysis with several re-sampling rates compared.Results showed that the combination of cubic spline interpolation and the Welch periodogram to be an optimal choice for least errors and spectral analysis of pulse interval series.And the mean pulse rate was the optimal resampling rate.Thirty healthy subjects and thirty subjects with coronary heart disease（CHD） were tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.Results showed that spectral analysis of the subjects with CHD was significantly lower than that of the healthy subjects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2009</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Liu2009Acta" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Construction method for normalized histogram of RR sequence and its application for evaluation heart failure</div> <div class="author">Liu, C., Liu, C.,  <em>Zhang, Q.</em>, and Li, Q. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>ACTA BIOPHYSICA SINICA</em> 2009 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> A new method for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, normalized histogram of RR sequence, was proposed and applied to evaluate the heart failure of the subjects.
