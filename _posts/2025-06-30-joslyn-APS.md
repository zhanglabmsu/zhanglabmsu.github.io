Joslyn Claypool, an undergraduate research assistant in our lab, recently won two prestigious awards: the 2025 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship from the American Physiological Society (one of the 12 students internationally) and a research support fellowship from MSUâ€™s College of Natural Science. A double major in neuroscience and psychology, Joslyn is investigating how adenosine, a chemical affected by caffeine, influences brain blood flow and inflammation.
To learn more about Joslyn and her research , please read the [Student Spotlight](https://physiology.natsci.msu.edu/physiology-news/student-spotlight-joslyn-claypool.aspx) article posted by our departmental communication team.
Congratulations, Joslyn!
